# Peripheral immune cells contributing to neurodegeneration

## Background

<!-- Add a description of your project. -->

This project explores whether peripheral immune cells mediate
neurodegenerative diseases in an ancestry specific manner. It does this
in 2 ways:

- First it explores the extent and pattern of expression of
  neurodegenerative diseases in peripheral immune cells
- It then uses genetic colocalisation to explore whether the expression
  of these genes in peripheral immune cells is causally linked with the
  risk of disease.

Noting that regional selection pressures will affect environmental-host
interactions in a region specific manner, this analysis was undertaken
comparing African, East Asian and European ancestries.

## Reproducibility

<!-- Modify selection below depending on how package dependencies have been managed. -->

### `renv`

<!-- Consider using renv for reproducibility. Delete this section if you will not be doing this. -->

This repository uses [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html)
to create a reproducible environment for this R project.

1.  When you first launches this project, `renv` should automatically
    bootstrap itself, thereby downloading and installing the appropriate
    version of `renv` into the project library.
2.  After this has completed, you can use `renv::restore()` to restore
    the project library locally on your machine.

For more information on collaborating with `renv`, please refer to this
[link](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/collaborating.html).
